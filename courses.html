<b>THE SAVAGE IN FILM</b> <br>
6/6/19 - 8/8/19 <br><br>
In <i>Civilization and its Discontents</i>, Freud addresses the great paradox of civilization: that although it was established in order to protect our happiness, it is one of our greatest sources of discontentment. From this discontentment arose the romantic archetype of the "noble savage", conceptualized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the man outside of civilization who is thus free from sin and conception of right-and-wrong. In this course, we assess films featuring the archetype of the man-outside-society in order to examine how cinematic persectives of deviance may be reflective of the relationship between individuals and civilization, and its implications.

<b>APPROPRIATION // ALTERATION // EXPLORATION</b> <br>
7/20/2019 - 12/21/19 <br><br>
Guy Debord and the Situationist Internationale (SI) proposed the idea of the dérive as a kind of aimless drifting through the built environment which allows for critique and subversion of the built environment. We will apply the principles outlined by the Situationists to critique and subvert our own built environment. Additionally, we will assess texts which feature the acknowledgment and irreverent re-use of literature and forms. In particular, we will explore the possibilities of texts which are aware of, and possibly subversive of, their own intended use. We set forth the intention of honing our own attention to and irreverence for the structures we inhabit, mentally and physically.
